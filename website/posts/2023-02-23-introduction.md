An introduction, an example, a **kitchen** _sink_.

leblog is meant to:

1. Be easy to install and use.
2. Have sensible defaults.
3. Be configurable.

And

Images work too:
![Family reading a newspaper](/reading_a_newspaper.png)

> As do blockquotes.

Inline `code`, and blocks too:

```js
console.error('whoops')
```

And footnotes[^1].

[^1]: Footnotes are so great.

And _tables_:
